# Zebra Redux

Zebra Redux is a theme for u-he [Zebra](https://u-he.com/products/zebra2/)/[ZebraHZ](https://u-he.com/products/soundsets/zebra2-soundsets.html#darkzebra) made with sound designers in mind. The goal of this project is to let the process of creating new sounds with Zebra be more comfortable and intuitive.

Zebra Redux suggests a new workflow and besides the streamlined one-page UI it also introduces some unique features:

- descriptive icons for various module functions
- separate racks for different module types (Generators, Filters, Envelopes, LFOs etc.)
- inline editors for OSC and MSEG modules
- dedicated OSC and MSEG editors with helpful grids
- color-coded labels and knobs
- easy to use piano roll style arpeggiator
- full size performance view
- global configuration module
- master FX and Diva filters as rack modules
- detailed patch information and inline tag editor on Presets page

Zebra Redux supports all features of the original theme including drag-n-drop, Preferences and MIDI Learn panels.
