# Zebra Redux

Zebra Redux is a theme for u-he [Zebra](http://www.u-he.com/cms/zebra)/[ZebraHZ](http://www.u-he.com/cms/118-tdz-news) made with sound designers in mind. The goal of this project is to let the process of creating new sounds with Zebra be more comfortable and intuitive.

Zebra Redux suggests a new workflow and besides the streamlined one-page UI it also introduces some unique features:

- descriptive icons for various module functions
- local XY pads
- inline editors for OSC and MSEG modules
- dedicated OSC and MSEG editors with helpful grids
- color-coded labels and knobs
- easy to use piano roll style arpeggiator
- extended performance view
- global configuration module
- user color schemes

Zebra Redux supports all features of the original theme including drag-n-drop, Preferences and MIDI Learn panels.
